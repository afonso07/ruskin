# ruskin. An Art Copilot

Introducing ruskin: Your personal art critic powered by the new OpenAI Vision API! 🎨✨ Watch as GPT-4 analyzes your chosen masterpiece, while ElevenLabs narrates the artistic journey. Inspired by John Ruskin, ruskin serves as an art co-pilot, bridging the gap between AI tools and human creativity. It enhances, not replaces, the artist's vision.
