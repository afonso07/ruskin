# ruskin. An Art Copilot

Introducing ruskin: Your personal art critic powered by the new OpenAI Vision API! üé®‚ú® Watch as GPT-4 analyzes your chosen masterpiece, while David Attenborough narrates the artistic journey. Inspired by John Ruskin, ruskin serves as an art co-pilot, bridging the gap between AI tools and human creativity. It enhances, not replaces, the artist's vision.

## Disclamer
This project is for educational purposes only. I do not intend to commercialize this initiative, and the generated voice has not been shared. It's essential to clarify that this project has not been approved by David Attenborough. The focus is on exploring the intersection of technology and art appreciation while respecting ethical considerations.
